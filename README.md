FunWithParticles
================

This is a game/simulator that I started after having my wisdom teeth pulled after reading a neat article on algorithmic color generation. It started out as a bouncy ball simulator with random colors and has developed from there.

Features
========
### Particle Types
*  **Ball:** Bouncing balls that explode from your cursor and bounce of the walls and floor.
*  **Spark:** Like fireworks. Particles explode from your curosr leaving a trail of sparks that float whimsically toward the ground before dying out.
*  **Fizzle:** Originally a bug with spark that I kept. Basically just random concentrations of particles that fizzle out slowly. Its hard to describe....
*  **Circles** Cirlces whose center acts like a Ball, but whose radius is determined by its distance from the bottom.
*  **Frozen:** Particles don't update .gmail
